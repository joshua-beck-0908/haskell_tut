    "I like this idea, even if I don't yet understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have some kind of idea from things I've read, but speculation from limited information can be the greatest threat to your understanding.\n",

    "\n",
    ">Â The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number, the sum of a list of numbers is the first number plus the sum of all the other numbers, and so on. You express that in the form of functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So every thing takes to form of functions and forumulae instead of flow control? It sounds more like mathematics than programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You also can't set a variable to something and then set it to something else later. If you say that a is 5, you can't say it's something else later because you just said it was 5. What are you, some kind of liar? So in purely functional languages, a function has no side effects. The only thing a function can do is calculate something and return it as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haha, programmers are such terrible liars. But not changing variables on the fly? Interesting. I'm keen to know more! ðŸ™‚\n",
    "\n",

    "> Haskell is lazy. That means that unless specifically told otherwise, Haskell won't execute functions and calculate things until it's really forced to show you a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I support that's what would allow the definition of generic formulae. \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea came up when I looked into Python generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like it's more complete here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept that a function can return... abstract unbounded data. A function that stretches to infinity. But it avoid turning those into concrete values until you actually ask for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language adds layers and layers of functions and when you want to actually turn those into a concrete value it works its way back through the chain of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the real world, Haskell is statically typed with the same kind of type inference you see in a lot of modern languages.\n",
